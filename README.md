<!-- PATCHES_END -->

The single patch, **Android 11 support**, sets `android:minSdkVersion="30"` in AndroidManifest.xml.

## Known limitations
- The Bluetooth status icon needs the Android 12-only BLUETOOTH_CONNECT permission, so it stays hidden on Android 11.
- The app's native emulator cores were built against API 31. If one uses a function Android 11 lacks, the app may crash when that core loads.
- Targets slot. v2.1.0 (and v2.0.0). Edit `Constants.kt` if a release reports a different versionName.

## Build
Needs Java 17+ and a GitHub token with `read:packages` (Morphe's plugin is on GitHub Packages).

    export GITHUB_TOKEN=your-token
    ./gradlew buildAndroid        # -> patches/build/libs/patches-*.mpp

Apply the `.mpp` with Morphe Desktop, or publish via the template's `release.yml`
